/** SessionLayout — the injection seam that decouples "where a session's state
 *  tree lives / how sessions are enumerated" from the generic session/agent
 *  machinery.
 *
 *  cli/core only ever call this interface; they do NOT know about "game".
 *  The product shell (packages/server, studio) injects a concrete layout via
 *  `ProductContext.sessionLayoutFactory(root)` → `initPathManager({ layout })`
 *  (a factory keyed by project root so a workspace switch can rebuild it). When no
 *  layout is injected, PathManager falls back to `FlatSessionLayout`, which
 *  reproduces the pre-seam behavior (sessions under `<userRoot>/sessions/`) —
 *  this is what lets @forgeax/orchestrator run as a standalone, game-agnostic CLI.
 *
 *  Operations:
 *    - `allocate`        the ONLY writer — establishes a new session's home
 *                        (studio = bind to the current active game), creates the
 *                        dir, returns its roots. Path-as-SSOT: after allocate the
 *                        binding lives in the on-disk path, not a stored field.
 *    - `sessionRoot`     state-tree root (WAL/logs/checkpoints). Pure read.
 *    - `sessionWorkDir`  agent working directory (studio = the bound game dir;
 *                        generic = projectRoot). Pure read.
 *    - `listSessionIds`  enumeration. Pure read. */
